<h1 class="page-header">The null bytes problem</h1>

<p><big><b>This problem has been solved in current versions of Mozilla, and Gnusto versions later than 0.5.0 can read binary files reliably.</b></p>

<h2>For historical interest</h2>

<p>In <del>all current</del> <ins>many older</ins> versions of Mozilla, JavaScript cannot reliably read a file which contains nulls. This includes all zcode story files. <del>People are <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170585">working on fixing this</a>, and as soon as it's ready,</del> <ins>This is now fixed, and</ins> Gnusto <del>will be</del> <ins>is</ins> able to load story files directly. <del>Of course, Gnusto can't reach v1.0 until this happens. [Update: It looks like this is fixed in the current tree, but it's not in any Mozilla releases yet. Looks good for the next release, though.]</del></p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you're testing Gnusto, you still need to be able to load story files. I experimented with a few options (uuencoding the files, for example) but they all ran into the same problem: they required a lot of JavaScript processing in order to get the data out. This made loading games very slow (on the order of ten seconds to load a 60K file).</p>

<p>In the end I devised a new encoding, mangled-z5 or "mz5", which doesn't suffer from this problem.

<p><b>Under Unix,</b> download <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/gnusto/mz5">the encoder here</a> (you'll need <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, but you probably already have it). If you have a story file called, say, <code>curses.z5</code>, then you can convert it to mz5 by typing <blockquote><kbd>./mz5 curses.z5</kbd></blockquote>at the $ or % prompt.</p>

<p><b>Under Windows,</b> you may either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/gnusto/mz5">the Perl encoder</a>, just as under Windows; type <blockquote><kbd>mz5 curses.z5</kbd></blockquote>at the Command Prompt to use it. Thanks to Cedric Knight for making the necessary changes to let this program run under Windows.</li>
<li>You can also download <a href="http://www.batmantis.com/gnusto/">an mz5 conversion utility</a> for Windows which doesn't need Perl (I haven't tested this, but you might well find it useful). Thanks to Eric Liga for providing this.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also download Dylan O'Donnell's game <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/gnusto/troll.mz5"><cite>A Troll's Eye View</cite> already encoded in mz5</a>.</p>

<h2>The details of the mz5 encoding</h2>
<p>The encoding had to</p>
<ul>
<li>guarantee that the file contained no nulls</li>
<li>be achievable using xpconnect calls as much as possible, rather than JS processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source file is considered as an array of bytes: <var>source[]</var>. The encoded file is the concatenation of two arrays <var>values[]</var> and <var>fixups[]</var>, both the same length as <var>source[]</var>. Thus a file of size <var>n</var> will have size <var>2n</var> after encoding.</p>

<p>For any byte offset <var>x</var> where 0 &lt;= <var>x</var> &lt; <var>n</var>:
<ul>
<li>if <var>source[x]</var>==0<ul>
<li><var>values[x]</var> may have any nonzero value.<br>
Canonically this should be <b>48</b> decimal (digit "0" in ASCII).</li>
<li><var>fixups[x]</var>==<b>89</b> decimal (capital "Y" in ASCII)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if <var>source[x]</var>!=0<ul>
<li><var>values[x]</var>==<var>source[x]</var></li>
<li><var>fixups[x]</var> may have any nonzero value other than 89 decimal.<br>
Canonically this should be <b>156</b> decimal (little "n" in ASCII).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p>

<p>This lets us load the entire file in one go using xpconnect, in return for a performance loss of having to look at two positions in the file every time we want to retrieve one character. (In fact, since the current read method in xpcom returns a string rather than a byte array, and we need to update it as if it were an array, we are already copying values out of the string into the array, so we need between one and three checks: three if the value has not yet been copied out, and one subsequently when it has.) The new null-safe interface is going to return results as a byte array, so we'll be able to do without all this.</p>
