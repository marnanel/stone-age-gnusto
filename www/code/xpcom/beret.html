<h1 class="page-header">The beret</h1>
<h2><code>@gnusto.org/beret;1</code></h2>

<p>The purpose of the beret is to take incoming files, decide their type, and send them where they belong. It does this using magic numbers. Although the files are often routed into the beret by gnusto-service using their MIME types, the beret ignores both the MIME types and the extensions of files.</p>

<p>The beret is capable of parsing Electronic Arts's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFF"><abbrev title="Interchange File Format">IFF</abbrev></a> format in order to determine the type of a file. Within the IFF forms there may be still further distinctions.</p>

<p>The beret also currently parses grimoire files. This job may eventually be split out into another component.</p>

<p>The following table shows the types that the beret understood at the time of writing. This means that any of these files may be loaded in any way Gnusto understands.</p>
