<p align="right"><b>Historical</b><br>
Replaced by: <code><a href="bocardo.html">Bocardo</a></code></p>

<p>Barbara was the screen handler before Bocardo was introduced. <small>(The section names came later; Barbara was never called Barbara at the time.)</small></p>

<p>It used two separate HTML panes to represent the upper and lower windows of the Z-machine: a very imperfect match. However, it was <em>fast</em>: the most common operation, appending text to the lower screen, involved only two <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/"><acronym title="document object model">DOM</acronym></a> operations (creating a new text node, and appending it to a (cached) position within the document).</p>

<p>Barbara's upper screen handler developed into <a href="bocardo.html">Bocardo</a>.</p>
