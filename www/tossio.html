<h5 class="page-header">Tossio-- Gnusto's debugger</h5>

<p><a href="/">Gnusto</a> has a built-in debugger, named <dfn>Tossio</dfn> after the spell to turn granite into <a href="http://www.vikingrange.com/recipes/cajun_fettuccine.html">fettucine</a>.</p>

<p>Tossio is in its early stages at present. One day, it will have a GUI; until then, <strike>you can execute a tossio command by giving an instruction starting with a slash, in place of a command to the story</strike>. <ins>(No longer: changes to the parser have meant that Tossio can't be called from standard builds. It should return around the New Year of 2004.)</ins> Tossio is <strong>not yet recommended for general use</strong>, though it's interesting to play with and occasionally useful in solving problems. It only works at the z-code level at present; eventually it will also work with <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/introduction/">Inform</a> source files.</p>

<p>These Tossio commands are defined at present:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/help</dt>
<dd>
lists all the tossio commands.
</dd>
<dt>/open <var>xxx</var></dt>
<dd>
open mangled story file <var>xxx</var>.
</dd>
<dt>/status</dt>
<dd>
print the value of the program counter and so on
</dd>
<dt>/on</dt>
<dd>
turn on debug mode. (This is too vague!)
</dd>
<dt>/dis</dt>
<dd>
dissembles current story file. This can take a few seconds.
Tossio won't dissemble again if it already has the information.
Some commands will invoke this automatically.
</dd>
<dt>/showjs</dt>
<dd>
make /status show current JIT JavaScript.
</dd>
<dt>/parser</dt>
<dd>
make tossio show some additional parser debugging
</dd>
<dt>/step</dt>
<dd>
step one place through (unlikely to be one opcode because of JIT; this should be cleaner)
</dd>	
<dt>/run</dt>
<dd>
runs on until something interesting happens
</dd>
<dt>/context</dt>
<dd>
shows dissembly around program counter
</dd>
<dt>/set</dt>
<dd>
sets a breakpoint
</dd>
<dt>/clear</dt>
<dd>
clears a breakpoint
</dd>
<dt>/show <var>type</var> <var>id</var></dt>
<dd>
shows the value of a variable
</dd>
<dt>/put</dt>
<dd>
sets the value of a variable
</dd>
<dt>/about</dt>
<dd>
displays the about box
</dd>
</dl>
