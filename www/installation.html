<p><strong>Please read <a href="releasenotes060.html">the release notes for v0.6.0</a> before installing it.</strong> Thanks. Gnusto is still under development, and the release notes tell you the pitfalls you should be aware of. 

<p>If you're running under Unix, you can now install gnusto without logging in as root.  Just choose the "install to profile" option
when prompted during the installation.  If you wish to install to the main program directory, you must do so as root.</p>

<p>If you have an earlier version of gnusto installed, you must uninstall it (the <a href="releasenotes050.html">release notes</a> for the previous version have instructions for a manual uninstall) and delete the entire gnusto program directory (found inside Mozilla's "chrome" directory) before installing. If that's not possible, you could also try reinstalling the browser.
    This version includes an uninstaller, so this step will not be required in future versions.</p>

<p>To install gnusto v0.6.0 (the September 2003 release), click on the picture below:</p>

<h2>Starting gnusto</h2>

<p>Then either:</p>
<ul>
<li>restart Mozilla Firebird (as an ordinary user) and choose "Gnusto" from the Tools menu.</li>
<li><b>or</b> start Mozilla Firebird from the command line thus:<blockquote><kbd>MozillaFirebird -chrome chrome://gnusto/content</kbd></blockquote></li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding stories to use</h2>

<p>You can get other story files for testing Gnusto from:
<ul>
<li>the IF Archive-- try <a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/platform/1">searching <cite>Baf's Guide</cite> for Z-machine games</a> (Gnusto will eventually let you do this from within the program.)</li>
<li>using Infocom classic games such as <a href="http://underworld.fortunecity.com/track/946/">these</a>, some of which can even be <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/hhgg.z5">downloaded from official sites</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feed back on which games work and which don't by <a href="bugs.html">raising bugs</a>.</p>
