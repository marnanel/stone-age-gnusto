<p><big><b>Don't bother downloading v0.1.0; a new release is imminent. The site is being rewritten in preparation.</b></big> Check back soon!</p>

<p>If you're running under Unix, <strong>you must be running Mozilla as root to install add-ons</strong>. (You're adding new software, after
all.) The exception is if you installed Mozilla originally as a non-root user, in which case you should run it as that user.</p>

<p>To install gnusto v0.1.0, click on the link below:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="#" onclick="triggerURL('http://downloads.mozdev.org/gnusto/gnusto-0.1.0.xpi');">[ Install gnusto v0.1.0 ]</a></p>

<p>Then restart Mozilla (as an ordinary user) and choose "Interactive Fiction"
from the Tools menu.</p>

<p><b><a href="nullbytes.html">You will also need the mz5 program</a></b> until the Mozilla null byte bug is fixed. Sorry. Follow the link to find out why, and where you can get the program.</p>

<p>To begin your testing, you may download <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/gnusto/troll.mz5"><cite>A Troll's Eye View</cite> in mz5 encoding</a> from mozdev, all ready to play.</p>

<p>You can get other story files from the IF Archive-- try <a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/platform/1">searching <cite>Baf's Guide</cite> for Z-machine games</a>. (In the future, Gnusto will let you do this from within the program.) Please feed back on which games work and which don't by <a href="bugs.html">raising bugs</a>. Currently:</p>

<dl><dt>Games that don't work</dt>
<dd>Curses (seems to be a parsing problem). Christminster (strange property errors)</dd>
<dt>Games that do</dt>
<dd>A Troll's Eye View. Jailbait on I-0.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that Gnusto currently only supports version 5. Most of these games are v5, but some may be v3 or v8. The site will tell you which.</p>
