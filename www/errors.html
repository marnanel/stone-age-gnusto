<h5 class="page-header">Error codes</h5>

<table border>
<tr>
<th>Number (decimal)</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr><th>1xx</th><td>
<b>Z-machine internal errors.</b> These are caused by bugs inside Gnusto's
Z-machine itself. If you see one of these, <a href="/bugs.html">please check
whether it's already been reported, and if it hasn't, report it</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>100</th><td><b>Can't modify gosub.</b> The program passed a subroutine
call into another function, but the call was too complicated for that function
to be able to figure out how to insert a handler for the return value. </td></tr>

<tr><th>101</th><td><b>Not implemented.</b> The story attempted to use an
opcode, or a feature of an opcode, that really should exist but doesn't.
You should report this as an enhancement request, if it hasn't already been
reported.</td></tr>

<tr><th>170<br>to<br>199</th><td>
<b>"Impossible" errors</b>. These happen when control reaches a place it
should logically never be able to reach. Obviously, this means the logic
is broken.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>170</th><td> impossible-- code_for_varcode()</td></tr>
<tr><th>171</th><td> impossible-- dissemble()</td></tr>
<tr><th>172</th><td> impossible-- get_prop_len()</td></tr>
<tr><th>173</th><td> impossible-- get_next_prop()</td></tr>
<tr><th>174</th><td> impossible-- get_prop()</td></tr>
<tr><th>175</th><td> impossible-- property_search()</td></tr>

<tr><th>199</th><td><b>Extended opcode.</b> Opcode 190 is handled specially,
and so shouldn't ever be treated as an ordinary opcode. If it is, this happens.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>2xx</th><td>
<b>Fatal story errors.</b> These happen when Gnusto's Z-machine thinks it's found
a fault in your story that means everything has to stop. It may be wrong; if it is,
it should be <a href="/bugs.html">reported as a bug in Gnusto</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>200</th><td><b>Unknown opcode.</b> The story used an opcode that
Gnusto doesn't know. If the opcode is defined in the Z-spec, this should be
reported as an enhancement request.</td></tr>

<tr><th>201</th><td><b>Lost in space.</b> A special case of 200.
There is no opcode zero, and zero is what you're most likely to find in
odd places in memory. So opcode zero triggers this error.</td></tr>

<tr><th>202</th><td><b>Too many memory streams.</b> A story can write
a stream of data into its own memory. The spec says that a story may
only have sixteen of these at once. If you try and open seventeen of
them, you get this error.</td></tr>

<tr><th>203</th><td><b>No more memory streams.</b> If a story attempts
to stop writing a stream of data into its own memory, but there isn't one
to stop, it will cause this error.</td></tr>

<tr><th>204</th><td><b>Weird output stream number.</b> The spec defines
four kinds of output streams, and the story attempted to use a number which
didn't correspond to any of them.</td></tr>

<tr><th>206</th><td><b>Unreal property.</b> The story asked what followed
a particular property of an object, and there wasn't such a property.</td></tr>

<tr><th>207</th><td><b>Unreal cookie thrown.</b> The story attempted to <code>@throw</code>
something that couldn't be <code>@throw</code>n-- for example, because it
hadn't previously been <code>@catch</code>ed.</td></tr>

<tr><th>3xx</th><td><b>Glue errors.</b> These are errors in the interface
between Mozilla and the Z-machine.</td></tr>

<tr><th>300</th><td><b>JavaScript compile error</b> ("unhappy source"). This
error is caused when one of Gnusto's own source code files fails to compile.</td></tr>

<tr><th>
301
</th><td><b>
File not found.
</b>
You asked Gnusto to load a file which doesn't exist.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>
302
</th><td><b>
Invalid store.
</b>
The story attempted to write something invalid to memory.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>
303
</th><td><b>
Unearthly window.
</b>
Version 5 stories have only two windows. This error occurs when they try to use one
that doesn't exist.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>
304
</th><td><b>
Unknown effect.
</b>
When Gnusto's engine wants to stop and send some sort of signal to its environment,
it uses a numeric code called an "effect". This error occurs when the effect number is unknown.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>
307
</th><td><b>
General exception.
</b>
Something happened within Gnusto which caused an exception that wasn't otherwise caught.
The last-ditch handler saw it, though, and generated this error.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>
308
</th><td><b>
Can't create spontaneous transcript.
</b>
This should be quite a rare one.
The engine is supposed to notify its environment before it starts sending out transcript
information. If it starts anyway, the environment will attempt to deal by setting up a
transcript file anyway. That can fail, though, in which case this error will be generated.
</td></tr>


<tr><th>7xx</th><td>
<b>Transient story errors.</b> These happen when Gnusto's Z-machine thinks it's found
a fault in your story which can probably be worked around. It may be wrong in
thinking that it's found a bug; if it is, the problem should be
<a href="/bugs.html">reported as a bug in Gnusto</a>. Transient errors will be
reported, but Gnusto will attempt to work around them.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>700</th><td><b>Spurious restore_undo.</b> The story attempted to
restore_undo without first successfully save_undoing.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>701</th><td><b>Division by zero.</b> Gnusto will supply zero as
the answer if asked to carry on.</td></tr>

<tr><th>702</th><td><b>Illegal ZSCII code.</b> The story attempted to output
a ZSCII character outside the permitted range, which is 0-1023. Gnusto will
supply 42 ('*') as the answer if asked to carry on.</td></tr>

<tr><th>703</th><td><b>Unknown ZSCII code.</b> The story attempted to output
a ZSCII character which Gnusto didn't know how to handle. Gnusto will
supply 42 ('*') as the answer if asked to carry on.</td></tr>

<tr><th>704</th><td><b>Put undefined property.</b> The story attempted to
set a property, but didn't tell Gnusto which one. You think we're mindreaders
here?</td></tr>

<tr><th>705</th><td><b>Property too long to put.</b> The put_prop opcode
only works for properties with lengths less than three bytes.</td></tr>

<tr><th>706</th><td><b>Property too long to get.</b> The get_prop opcode
only works for properties with lengths already less than three bytes.
(You can get at the data in other ways, just not with this opcode.)
Gnusto will return the first two bytes if asked to carry on.<br><br>
<i>This error is ignored by default</i> to work around a bug in old
versions of the Inform library. See <a href="http://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3314">bug 3314</a>.
