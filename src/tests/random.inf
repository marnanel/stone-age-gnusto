! Gnusto tests: random number generator
! Copyright (c) 2003 Thomas Thurman. Distributed under v2 of the GNU GPL.
!
! Note:
!  This file can't be part of the final version of Gnusto, since
!  (obviously) it depends on Inform, and Inform is nonfree, which
!  will keep Gnusto out of the main parts of some distributions
!  (notably Debian). I'm figuring out a solution to this, but for
!  now this file can stay here.
!
! This program prints four lines of twenty single-digit numbers.
! The first row is prefixed "1:", the second "P:" and the third "R:".
! "1:" are the first twenty numbers generated by the Z-machine when it
! starts up. "S:" are the first twenty numbers generated given a known
! low seed (15). "P:" are the first twenty numbers generated given
! a known high seed (1234). "R:" are the first twenty numbers generated
! after the machine has been told it should randomise.
!
! "P:" and "S:" should keep the same value over multiple invocations.
! "S:" should also contain an obvious repeating pattern (1-9, 1-6,
! then the same again). "R:" should always differ. The behaviour of
! "1:" depends on how the machine has been told to seed its RNG.
!
! Sample output:
!
!    1: 9 3 5 3 6 4 3 6 5 5 7 7 4 3 8 3 7 3 6 4
!    S: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5
!    P: 7 1 3 1 6 3 3 6 3 5 5 1 6 4 9 8 8 1 8 7
!    R: 9 3 5 3 6 4 3 6 5 5 7 7 4 3 8 3 7 3 6 4
