! Gnusto tests: random number generator
! Copyright (c) 2003 Thomas Thurman. Distributed under v2 of the GNU GPL.
!
! Note:
!  This file can't be part of the final version of Gnusto, since
!  (obviously) it depends on Inform, and Inform is nonfree, which
!  will keep Gnusto out of the main parts of some distributions
!  (notably Debian). I'm figuring out a solution to this, but for
!  now this file can stay here.
!
! This program prints three lines of ten single-digit numbers.
! The first row is prefixed "1:", the second "P:" and the third "R:".
! "1:" are the first ten numbers generated by the Z-machine when it
! starts up. "P:" are the first ten numbers generated given a known
! seed. "R:" are the first ten numbers generated after the machine has
! been told it should randomise.
!
!
! "P:" should keep the same value over multiple invocations. "R:"
! should always differ. The behaviour of "1:" depends on how the
! machine has been told to seed its RNG.
!
! Sample output:
!
!    1: 9 3 8 2 1 1 7 9 1 2
!    P: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1
!    R: 9 3 8 2 1 1 7 9 1 2
