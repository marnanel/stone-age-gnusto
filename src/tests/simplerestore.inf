! Note:
!  This file can't be part of the final version of Gnusto, since
!  (obviously) it depends on Inform, and Inform is nonfree, which
!  will keep Gnusto out of the main parts of some distributions
!  (notably Debian). I'm figuring out a solution to this, but for
!  now this file can stay here.
!
! This program accepts an infinite series of keystrokes. It keeps
! a value stored in a variable. If the keystroke is:
!    "."       it will print the contents of the variable
!    "S"       it will save
!    "R"       it will save
!    Otherwise it will set the variable to the keystroke and print it.
