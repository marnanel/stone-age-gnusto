! Note:

!  (obviously) it depends on Inform, and Inform is nonfree, which
!  will keep Gnusto out of the main parts of some distributions
!  (notably Debian). I'm figuring out a solution to this, but for
!  now this file can stay here.

! This program performs the "@verify" instruction and prints
! "YES" if the verification works and "NO" if it doesn't.
