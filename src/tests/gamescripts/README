Gamescripts
===========

These are some scripts to use as input to Gnusto to play a game
right through.

There are two kinds of scripts: ".ini" scripts and ".playback"
scripts. ".playback" scripts just contain what to type into the
story, line by line. There is a list of these below. ".ini"
scripts are more structured; they contain all that a ".playback"
script contains, and also show how to tell whether the game
has been won, amongst other things. They are made to be played by
the $/src/tools/playthrough.py program.
